## Description
Add color cards to your figma designs. This allows you to build a pallete or showcase colors for inspiration. You can generate custom names using "The Color API" for easily adding your new colors to your library.

## How to Use

### Color Name
Add a name for your card in the "Color Name" text box. Next, click on the color box to select a color or enter in a hex color code in the box next to it.

### Color Value
**Note** : The Hex code must include the hash `#` at the beginning and must have six characters following the hash.  The input is case insensitive. So, both uppercase and lowercase letters are valid to be used. An invalid input will cause the card to not be generated.

Ex :

```
// Valid Inputs
#adc3ec
#ADC3EC

//Invalid Inputs
#fff
e9dfea
#00000
```

### Card Size
The card size select will determine the demensions of your card. The default card size is medium. There are five sizes in total :

| Size     | Height  | Width  |
| -------- | ------- | ------ |
| Small    | 200 px  | 130 px |
| Medium   | 400 px  | 260 px |
| Large    | 600 px  | 390 px |
| X-Large  | 800 px  | 520 px |
| XX-Large | 1000 px | 650 px |

### Color API
If you check the "Use Color API?" box, a custom name will be pulled from the color API. **This will overwrite the name in the "Color Name" input**.
